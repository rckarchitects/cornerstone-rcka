<p>Cornerstone is RCKa's bespoke architectural practice management system
It is a web-based management system for small architectural practices. It has been developed by <a href="http://www.rcka.co.uk">RCKa architects</a> over several years to assist with day-to-day tasks that are often laborious and time-consuming.
The Architects' Journal has recently published an article about the software and our reasons for making it open-source. You can read this article here: <a href="http://bit.ly/1LvQgS5">http://bit.ly/1LvQgS5</a>
Please note that the platform is still at a very early stage of development, and so you are likely to find numerous bugs, glitches and other issues that may mean it doesn't quite function how you expect. You might even struggle to install it.
There's also no documentation - at least for the time being. But we're working on all of these things and hope to make it easier to use and install soon.
A list of some of the features included within Cornerstone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time tracking / analysis</li>
<li>Invoicing</li>
<li>CRM (Customer Relationship Management) / Contacts database</li>
<li>Drawing / document issue</li>
<li>QMS (Quality Management System)</li>
<li>Task management</li>
<li>Tender preparation</li>
<li>Project journals</li>
<li>Staff holiday management</li>
<li>Expenses management</li>
<li>Planning condition tracker</li>
<li>Project checklist</li>
</ul>

<p>Cornerstone runs on a standard web server using MySQL, Apache and PHP, so some knowledge of these things will be required to get it up and running. Probably best to come back soon when we've made more progress in simplifying the installation process.</p>
